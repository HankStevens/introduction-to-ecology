This book provides an activity-based approach introduction to the science and practice of ecology. It is designed to form the basis of an undergraduate general ecology course. It includes real-world assessment activities, and so answer keys are not generally available, even if they might be appropriate in some situations.

Each chapter provides,

* links to background information in the form of a video lecture, peer-reviewed publications, and sometimes other sources,
* one or more writing assignments, and
* data exploration and modeling.

My other books include [*A Primer of Ecology using R*](https://hankstevens.github.io/Primer-of-Ecology/) and [*A Primer of Ecosystem Modeling*](https://hankstevens.github.io/ecosystems-primer/). The former (Primer of Ecology) is designed primarily for graduate students as a primer to theory in population community ecology. It was first published with Springer in 2009, and the current GitHub version is quite updated. I use the former (ecosystem modeling) when I co-instruct a graduate course led by colleagues who are real ecosystem ecologists (Drs. Melany Fisk, Mike Vanni, and Lesley Knoll).

*Mazel tov!*
